      "text": "Resolution adopted by the Congress Working Committee Meeting held today ‚Äî \n\nThe Congress Working Committee (CWC) expresses its deepest shock and condemnation of the heinous terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, on April 22, 2025, which claimed the lives of 26 innocent tourists and left more than 20 others grievously injured. The Congress Working Committee extends its deepest condolences to the bereaved families. It stands with them wholeheartedly in this moment of profound anguish.\n\nThis cowardly and calculated act of terror, mastermind by Pakistan, is a direct assault on the values of our Republic. The deliberate targeting of Hindus was done to inflame passions across the country.We appeal for calm in the face of this grave provocation and reaffirm our collective strength in the face of adversity. The CWC appeals for calm and reaffirms the Indian National Congress' longstanding resolve to combat cross-border terrorism with determination and unity.\n\nCWC also pays tribute to the local ponywalas and tourist guides, one of whom was martyred while selflessly trying to protect the tourist to uphold the idea of india.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the collective will of the nation, the Indian National Congress had, on the night of the 22nd itself, called for an all-party meeting chaired by the Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister. This meeting has now been scheduled for today.\n\nPahalgam is known to be a heavily guarded area, secured by a three-tier security https://t.co/0Bpk5WmzqP is imperative that a comprehensive analysis is conducted into the intelligence failures and security lapses that enabled such an attack in a Union Territory ‚Äî an area directly under the purview of the Union Home Ministry. These questions must be raised in the larger public interest. This is the only way justice can truly be seen to be served for the families whose lives have been so brutally devastated.\n\nThe CWC also notes that the Amarnath Yatra is set to commence shortly. Lakhs of pilgrims from across India participate in this annual journey, and their safety must be treated as a national priority. Robust, transparent, and proactive security arrangements must be put in place without delay. The safety of pilgrims, as well as the livelihoods of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, many of whom depend on tourism, must be protected with full sincerity and seriousness.\n\nThe massacre has rightly drawn condemnation from all political parties in Jammu and Kashmir and from a wide cross-section of its citizens. However, it is shocking that the BJP is exploiting this grave tragedy through official and proxy social media platforms to sow further discord, mistrust, polarisation and division at a time when unity and solidarity is most needed.\n\n#PahalgamTerroristAttack",
