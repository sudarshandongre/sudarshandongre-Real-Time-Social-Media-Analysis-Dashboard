      "text": "If you are referring to the over quota tariffs, you have them too\n\nThe USA has over quota tariffs on Canada & other countries which was first initiated under Smoot Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930’s. \n\nThe United States applies over-quota tariffs, also known as tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), to certain imported goods when they exceed a predetermined quota allowed at a lower or zero tariff rate. These tariffs protect domestic producers by making excess imports cost-prohibitive. \n\n### Dairy Products\nThe U.S. imposes significant over-quota tariffs on dairy to shield its producers. \n- **Cheese**: Rates vary by type:\n  - Cheddar: 12% to 16.8% over-quota, but some specialty cheeses (e.g., Swiss) can hit $1.70/kg or higher specific duties, effectively 20-30% depending on price.\n  - Blue-veined (e.g., Roquefort): Up to 35% or $2.11/kg.\n  - Other cheeses: Often 10-25%, with specific duties (e.g., $1.05-$2.27/kg) adding cost.\n- **Butter**: 10% to 30.9%, or specific rates like $1.541/kg, which can exceed 50% ad valorem equivalent for low-cost imports.\n- **Milk Powder (Nonfat Dry Milk)**: Around 3.9% to 25%, with specific duties (e.g., $0.775/kg) boosting effective rates.\n- **Fluid Milk/Cream**: Up to 77.2% or $0.657/liter, though rarely triggered due to low import volumes.\n\nQuotas are small—e.g., 5.4 million kg for cheddar annually—and over-quota rates apply once exceeded. For context, U.S. dairy imports were $4.1 billion in 2023, mostly within-quota from partners like the EU and New Zealand.\n\n### Sugar\nSugar TRQs are a cornerstone of U.S. agricultural policy:\n- **Raw Cane Sugar**: Over-quota tariff is about 33.87 cents/kg (roughly 150-200% ad valorem, depending on world prices), compared to 1.4606 cents/kg within-quota.\n- **Refined Sugar**: Up to 35.74 cents/kg over-quota (over 100% equivalent), vs. 3.6606 cents/kg within-quota.\n\nThe USDA sets quotas annually (e.g., 1.117 million metric tons for raw sugar in 2023), with over-quota rates deterring excess imports. Mexico, under USMCA, has quota-free access up to a negotiated limit, but beyond that, these rates apply.\n\n### Beef\nBeef TRQs target imports from non-FTA partners (e.g., outside USMCA, Australia, etc.):\n- **Fresh/Chilled/Frozen Beef**: 26.4% over-quota, vs. 4-10% within-quota or free from FTA countries like Canada.\n- Quota: Around 696,000 metric tons annually, with countries like Argentina facing over-quota rates if they exceed allocations.\n\n### Peanuts\nPeanuts have some of the highest U.S. over-quota tariffs:\n- **Shelled Peanuts**: 131.8% over-quota, vs. 6.6 cents/kg within-quota.\n- **Peanut Butter**: Up to 163.8% over-quota.\n- Quota: About 20,000 metric tons, protecting U.S. growers in states like Georgia.\n\n### Cotton and Tobacco\n- **Cotton**: Over-quota rates can reach 31.4 cents/kg (roughly 36% equivalent), vs. 1.5 cents/kg within-quota. Quota is around 41,000 metric tons.\n- **Tobacco**: Up to 350% over-quota (e.g., $4.62/kg), vs. 37.5 cents/kg within-quota, though imports are niche.\n\n### Other Goods\n- **Chocolate/Cocoa Products**: 15-20% over-quota, with specific duties (e.g., $0.52/kg).\n- **Tuna (Canned)**: 12.5% over-quota, vs. 6% within-quota.\n\n### Mechanism and Context\n- **How TRQs Work**: The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and USDA allocate quotas, often through trade agreements (e.g., WTO, USMCA). Within-quota imports get preferential rates (often 0% from FTA partners like Canada), while over-quota imports face the “most-favored-nation” (MFN) rate or higher specific duties from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS).\n- **Administration**: The U.S. Customs Service tracks imports, applying over-quota rates when thresholds are crossed. \n- **Trade Agreements**: USMCA eliminates over-quota tariffs for Canada and Mexico on most goods (e.g., dairy up to 50,000 tons for Canada), but non-FTA countries (e.g., Brazil, India) face them.\n\nIn summary, U.S. over-quota tariffs range from 10% (dairy) to 350% (tobacco), with peanuts (163.8%) and sugar (150-200%) among the highest",
