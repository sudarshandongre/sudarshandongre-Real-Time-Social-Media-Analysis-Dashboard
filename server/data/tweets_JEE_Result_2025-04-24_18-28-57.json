May Allah raise the ranks of the martyrs and grant patience to the bereaved.  Amen\n\n Since the regime change in Pakistan, the scourge of terrorism has been completely out of control.  Every day explosions and loss of precious lives are happening in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.  The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have made a lot of sacrifices against terrorism.  House-to-house funerals are held.  It has only been a while since peace was established that the genie of terrorism has once again come out of the bottle thanks to poor policies. \n\n The people of Pakistan are not ready to become the fuel of any war.  In this regard, a peace march was held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recently, which we fully support.  Peace will be our destiny only when people learn to fight for their rights. \n\n Apart from this, an important problem is the distribution of water in the small provinces of Pakistan and its solution is inevitable.  Sindh is currently going through a drought and the people there are raising their voices to protect their water rights, which we strongly support.   It is important to protect Pakistan's agricultural future that all provinces get their share of water.  We stand with the people of Sindh on the release of the new canal project without the consent of the true representatives of the people of Sindh.  We will defend the rights of Sindh at every level.  Distribution of water resources is subject to mutual consent of all provinces.\n\n Until all the institutions go back to their constitutional scope and a government with people's support comes in, the country will continue to suffer new crises every day - SIFC is an unconstitutional institution whose purpose was said to attract foreign investment - so far no investment has taken place, but various government departments have been put under military control, which has further destroyed the already degenerate state system - now the problem of farmers and canals is on the rise.  has done.",
