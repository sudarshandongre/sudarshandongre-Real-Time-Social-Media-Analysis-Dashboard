      "text": "ऋषभ पंत एक भारतीय क्रिकेटर हैं जो अपनी आक्रामक बल्लेबाजी और विकेटकीपिंग के लिए जाने जाते हैं। वह भारतीय राष्ट्रीय टीम के साथ-साथ इंडियन प्रीमियर लीग (IPL) में भी खेलते हैं। वर्तमान में, IPL 2025 में वह लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स (LSG) के कप्तान हैं, जिसने उन्हें नवंबर 2024 में हुए मेगा ऑक्शन में 27 करोड़ रुपये की रिकॉर्ड कीमत पर खरीदा था, जो उन्हें IPL इतिहास का सबसे महंगा खिलाड़ी बनाता है।\nहालांकि, IPL 2025 में अब तक उनका प्रदर्शन उम्मीदों के मुताबिक नहीं रहा है। सीजन के शुरुआती मैचों में वह बल्ले से प्रभाव नहीं छोड़ पाए हैं—उदाहरण के लिए, दिल्ली कैपिटल्स के खिलाफ 6 गेंदों में 0 रन, सनराइजर्स हैदराबाद के खिलाफ 15 रन, और पंजाब किंग्स के खिलाफ 5 गेंदों में 2 रन बनाकर आउट हुए। उनकी कप्तानी में लखनऊ को भी हार का सामना करना पड़ा है, जिसके बाद टीम मालिक संजीव गोयनका के साथ उनकी मैदान पर चर्चा सुर्खियों में रही।\nपंत का करियर शानदार रहा है, खासकर टेस्ट क्रिकेट में, जहां उन्होंने मुश्किल परिस्थितियों में यादगार पारियां खेली हैं। लेकिन मौजूदा IPL सीजन में उनके खराब फॉर्म और कप्तानी के फैसलों की आलोचना हो रही है। \nकरियर की प्रमुख उपलब्धियाँ:\nटेस्ट क्रिकेट में शानदार प्रदर्शन:  \nपंत ने 2018 में इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ अपने टेस्ट डेब्यू पर ही छाप छोड़ी थी। वह विदेशी सरजमीं (इंग्लैंड, ऑस्ट्रेलिया, दक्षिण अफ्रीका) पर शतक लगाने वाले पहले भारतीय विकेटकीपर हैं।\n\n2021 में गाबा (ऑस्ट्रेलिया) में उनकी नाबाद 89 रन की पारी ने भारत को ऐतिहासिक टेस्ट जीत दिलाई, जिसने ऑस्ट्रेलिया का 32 साल का अजेय रिकॉर्ड तोड़ा।\n\nउनके टेस्ट आंकड़े प्रभावशाली हैं—34 टेस्ट में 43.71 की औसत से 2401 रन, जिसमें 5 शतक और 11 अर्धशतक शामिल हैं।\n\rदिसंबर 2022 का कार एक्सीडेंट और वापसी:  \n30 दिसंबर 2022 को पंत का एक भयानक कार एक्सीडेंट हुआ, जिसमें वह गंभीर रूप से घायल हो गए थे। कई सर्जरी और लंबे रिहैबिलिटेशन के बाद उन्होंने 2024 IPL में क्रिकेट में वापसी की। उनकी इस वापसी को खेल जगत में प्रेरणादायक माना गया।\n\rIPL में रिकॉर्ड:  \nIPL 2025 की मेगा नीलामी में लखनऊ सुपर जायंट्स ने उन्हें 27 करोड़ रुपये में खरीदा, जो IPL इतिहास की सबसे बड़ी बोली है। इससे पहले वह दिल्ली कैपिटल्स के लिए खेलते थे, जहां उन्होंने 2018 में 684 रन बनाकर ऑरेंज कैप की दावेदारी पेश की थी।\n\rहाल की घटनाएं (अप्रैल 2025 तक):\nIPL 2025 में खराब फॉर्म:\nजैसा कि पहले बताया, पंत इस सीजन में बल्ले से संघर्ष कर रहे हैं। उनकी टीम, LSG, को शुरुआती चार में से तीन मैचों में हार मिली है। पंजाब किंग्स के खिलाफ हार के बाद उनकी कप्तानी और रणनीति पर सवाल उठे। मैदान पर उनकी टीम मालिक संजीव गोयनका के साथ गर्मागर्म बातचीत का वीडियो वायरल हुआ, जिसने विवाद को जन्म दिया।\n\nआलोचना और समर्थन:\nकुछ विशेषज्ञों का मानना है कि कप्तानी का दबाव उनके स्वाभाविक खेल को प्रभावित कर रहा है, जबकि उनके प्रशंसक अभी भी उनकी आक्रामक शैली और वापसी की कहानी का समर्थन कर रहे हैं।",
